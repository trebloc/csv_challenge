#CSV Challenge

Write a Ruby program to first assemble a single set of records by parsing data from 3 different file formats and then display these records sorted in 3 different ways.

###Guidelines

We hope that this exercise will allow us to evaluate your skills as a developer. The qualities that we pay special attention to are:

- Simplicity/elegance of design
- Adherence to good software engineering principles
- Maintainability (clean, easy to understand code)
- Effective use of the standard library
- Use of unit tests

###Input Data

A record consists of the following 5 fields: last name, first name, gender, date of birth and favorite color. You will be given 3 files, each containing records stored in a different format (`sample/comma.txt`, `sample/pipe.txt`, `sample/space.txt`).

* The pipe-delimited file lists each record as follows:  
  `lastName | firstName | middleInitial | gender | favoriteColor | dateOfBirth`
* The comma-delimited (csv) file looks like this:  
  `lastName, firstName, gender, favoriteColor, dateOfBirth`
* The space-delimited file looks like this:  
  `lastName firstName middleInitial gender dateOfBirth favoriteColor`

You may assume that the delimiters (commas, pipes and spaces) do not appear anywhere in the data values themselves. Write a Ruby program to read in records from these files and combine them into a single set of records.

###Display Requirements
* Create and display 3 different views of the recordset (see `sample/expected_output.txt`):

    - Output 1 – sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending.
    - Output 2 – sorted by birth date, ascending.
    - Output 3 – sorted by last name, descending.

* Ensure that fields are displayed in the following order: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.
* Display dates in the format M/D/YYYY.
